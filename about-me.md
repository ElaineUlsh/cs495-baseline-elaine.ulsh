# What programming languages have you used?
Lots. I am most proficient in Java, C, and Python. But I have also used JavaScript, Dart, HTML/CSS, 
Prolog, ML, SQL, MongoDB, and a few others as well.

# Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects?
Most recently I coded in an internship writing JavaScript in Google Apps Script how the automation of 
the creation of reports. Most of my coding, however, has been while completing class assignments.

# What was the largest program/system you've worked on?
That would be tied between 2 different programs. Since they're so different, it's hard to tell which 
one is actually larger. The first one was was in CS222 which we called the Recipe Book project. It was
written in Dart/Flutter and allowed users to store their recipes on the application. The second one was
in CS416 where we created a Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Network Simulator. It was written in 
Java.

# What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
I feel very comfortable writing functions that interact with each other as well as trying to find the 
most optimal solution to a problem. 

# What do you feel least comfortable doing?
I am not very comfortable with the use of very specific libraries. I think that learning how to use them 
can be quite difficult as most of them are extremely specific, require prior knowledge, and/or are not 
documented very well.

# What is my concentration?
I do not have one technically, but in the department, I believe they call it "General". I want to get my 
masters, so it made the most sense to me.
